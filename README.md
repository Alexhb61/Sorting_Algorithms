# Sorting_Algorithms
Attempts at optimal sorting algorithms.
## The three target open problems in sorting are:
1) A nlogn work logn depth Algorithm for sorting which is more practical than bitonic sort.
My most noteworthy attempt is a parallelization of mergesort written in haskell, which will compared to other sorts.
The algorithm is untested, and unproven.
2) A n work logn depth Algorithm for sorting small numbers in the range [0,poly(n)]
Two attempts are tinysort and smallsort.
Both Algorithms are untested.
3) A sub nlogn sorting algorithm which uses hashing and truncation. 
The algorithm is untested, and randomized.
## Less important problems
1) Discussing L vs NC^1 via sorting/permutation logic. Attempting a complexity theorem.
2) Analyzing Bitonic Merge. What happens when you feed this circuit a non-bitonic sequence.
