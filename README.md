# Sorting_Algorithms
Attempts at optimal sorting algorithms.
## The two target open problems in sorting are:
1) A nlogn work logn depth Algorithm for sorting which is more practical than bitonic sort.
My most noteworthy attempt is a parallelization of mergesort written in haskell, which will compared to other sorts.
The algorithm is untested, and unproven.
2) A n work logn depth Algorithm for sorting small numbers in the range [0,poly(n)]
Two attempts are tinysort and smallsort.
Both Algorithms are untested.
