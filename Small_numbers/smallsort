#Correctness:
This algorithm's top section breaks the bit range in half until the range is O(sqrt(n))
Then it breaks the list into O(sqrt(n)) sized sections & sorts all the sections.
It then takes the runs in each section and assignes them the appropriate location.
This algorithm can be seen as a parallelization of tinysort.
#runtime:
Depth is (logn)loglogn because its recursion is T(m) = 2T(m/2) + O(m) where m starts as log(m)
where the dpeth for each run is mostly in the prune and flatten step.
Work is nlogn because its T(n) = 2sqrt(n)T(sqrt(n)) + O(n) The largest term ending up being nlogn.
#note I thought this was nloglog(n) work until I noticed the error on type up.
